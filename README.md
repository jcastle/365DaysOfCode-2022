# 365DaysOfCode-2022

This repo is a collection of my May 2022 to May 2023 efforts to learn more about OSS with python and DevOps or DevSecOps. 

A couple years ago while working as the front-end engineer of [Code.gov](https://code.gov/), I almost completed [365 days of code](https://github.com/jcastle-zz/365DaysOfCode) in an effort to increase my front-end development and engineering skills by doing "hands-on" technical work every day. In those days, I was focused on front-end programming with HTML, CSS, and JScript primarily with ReactJS. I learned a lot about accessibility and DevOps engineering with CI/CD and automated testing across multiple cloud environments.

The following is a collection of books and coursework I am current reviewing in my coding and engineering learning journey.
